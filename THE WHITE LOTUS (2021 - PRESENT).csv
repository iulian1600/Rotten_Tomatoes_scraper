Susan Granger,"fresh, Original Score: 8/10","Moving to a deluxe cliff-side hotel in Taormina, Sicily. but once again revolving around a set of decadent, rich discontents. Mike White's anthology series is opulent, indulgent and compelling.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/susan-granger,50+

Helen Hawkins,"fresh, Original Score: 3/5","Mike White’s second series of The White Lotus, which has relocated for its second season from an upscale Hawaiian resort to the fleshpots of Sicily, is still a worthwhile watch, but it’s hard not to wonder where that special savour has gone this time.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/helen-hawkins,17
Sarah Ward,"fresh, ","As it proved the first time around with such potency, this series is exceptional at letting the supposedly straightforward and idyllic blister like a sunbather catching some rays — and at peeling away layers of ostensible ecstasy in a seeming utopia.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/sarah-ward,50+
Chris Wasser,"fresh, ","The plotting is almost as fabulous as the scenery, and the witty, ferocious dialogue suggests another round of devious and delicious satire. I am so in.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chris-wasser,50+
Sarah Marrs,"fresh, ","The White Lotus, while still a pleasure to watch from a schadenfreude standpoint, feels significantly defanged the second time around.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/sarah-marrs,50+
Inkoo Kang,"fresh, ","The airless sociological fatalism of Season 1... gives way to a more mature drama, as well as a deeper exploration of how the characters’ class concerns converge with gendered angst.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/inkoo-kang,50+
Wenlei Ma,"fresh, ","In some ways, it's a less frustrating experience than the first series. In others, it’s not as punchy.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/wenlei-ma,50+
Ty Burr,"fresh, Original Score: 3/4",Fans of the first iteration of Mike White’s “Lifestyles of the Rich and Awful” should recalibrate their expectations a bit.,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/ty-burr,7

Hannah Brown,"fresh, ","The show is more than the sum of its parts, and it is so well written and structured that you will be anxious for each new episode to begin.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/hannah-brown,50+
Nina Metz,"rotten, Original Score: 1.5/4","Even as it skewers these people, the show is too in love with the idea of being rich to really consider the rot at its core.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nina-metz,50+
Alci Rengifo,"fresh, ",Instantly proves to be a worthy follow-up to its excellent predecessor.,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alci-rengifo,50+

Carol Midgley,"fresh, Original Score: 4/5","[Tanya] embodies the show’s essence: that being filthy rich doesn’t make you happy. Indeed, it can make you wretchedly miserable. Enjoy the schadenfreude.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/carol-midgley,50+

Shirley Li,"fresh, ","For the most part, the pivot from observing class and racial politics to sexual politics works in The White Lotus’s favor. Season Two is as juicy as Season One, but it’s not as caustic in its approach.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/shirley-li,50+
Tara Bennett,"fresh, Original Score: 8/10","While overall less frenetic than Season One, White knows how to make watching the imploding the lives of the rich, and their collateral damage, both horrific and delicious.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/tara-bennett,50+
